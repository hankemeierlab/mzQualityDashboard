## Modify Internal Standards 

This table shows the current configuration of internal standards used. For each compound the original Internal Standard (IS) is shown, including their batch-corrected RSDQC. Selecting this internal standard in the most-right column will reset the internal standard to their configuration as provided in the data file.

For each compound, each compound / IS ratio is calculated, including their RSDQC and their batch-corrected RSDQC. This is shown in the `Suggested IS` and `Suggested RSDQC Corrected` columns. The internal standard shown here will result in the lowest batch-corrected RSDQC. This can also be seen in the heatmap in Plots -> RSDQCs. 

Note however that while an internal standard may result in a lower RSDQC, it is important that an internal standard also should fit the compound class of the compound.
