## QC Correction
This field allows you to select any *QC* sample type that was entered in the data _type_ column. By selecting a different QC, a complete analysis is done, including identifying outliers, performing batch correction and calculating other metrics. In some cases it can be useful to switch to a different QC sample if the default selection does not capture sufficient variation.
